# ionic-app

A simple form using ionic framework

I only have a plain design but to make up for that i make sure that the forms won't accept empty inputs just like what real forms would do.

Each empty field will have their own error message.

these are the samples of error message

It is made possible by using ToastController.

this is just a snippet of the condition that i use

if that condition is satisfied i routed the buttons in order to go to the homepage

this is what my homepage looks like

I also change the app-routing so that it will go to the login page directly after opening it to the localhost
